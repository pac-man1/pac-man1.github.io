    <div class="recipeIngredients"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>2 medium tomatoes</li>
    <li>12 ears fresh corn</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp water</li>
    <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to season</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>7 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <div class="recipeInstructions"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Boil a stock pot of water</li>
    <li>Prepare an ice bath in a large mixing bowl</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>[peel and seed tomatoes]</li>
    <li>First core tomatoes. Turn each tomato over and make a small X on the bottom end, cutting just through the skin but not into the flesh. Place the cored tomatoes in boiling water for 40 to 50 seconds. Remove from the hot water and immediately plunge into ice water. Keep the boiling water in the pot. When tomatoes are cold, remove from the water and peel with a paring knife, starting from the X. The skin should slip off easily.</li>
    <li>To seed the tomatoes, cut them in half horizontally, then seed by holding each tomato half under cold running water, gently squeezing, and allowing the water to flush out the seeds from the internal tomato sections.</li>
    <li>Place the tomatoes on a baking sheet on a silicon mat, drizzle with olive oil, bake in the oven about 20 minutes</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>[cook the corn and prep corn stock]</li>
    <li>Cook the corn in the boiling water 30-60 seconds until hot. Cook in batches as needed. Remove corn from the water and cool. Retain water. Cut corn off the cob, return husks to stock. Reserve 2 cups corn stock.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>[to cut corn off the cob]</li>
    <li>Use a bundt pan or a large bowl with a small upside down bowl inside. Place corn in the middle and cut down, with bowl collecting kernels.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>[aromatics]</li>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil and water in a 5 quart saucepan over medium heat. When hot, add the chopped celery and onion. Season with salt and pepper and sauté 5 minutes. Add half the kernels (about 2 cups) and sauté an additional 5 minutes. Add 4 cups chicken stock and 2 cups corn stock. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>[prepare a roux]</li>
    <li>While the stock is simmering prepare a roux by melting the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add the flour slowly while stirring. Cook until roux bubbles, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir constantly to prevent browning and scorching. Strain 4 cups simmering stock into the roux, whisking vigorously until smooth. Add this mixture to the saucepan with the remaining stock and vegetables and whisk until well combined. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>[finish]</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat. Purée the soup with a hand blender or blender, strain. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Return to low heat and hold at a simmer. Heat the tomatoes and remaining corn in a non-stick sauté pan over medium heat. Add to soup when hot, serve immediately.</li>
