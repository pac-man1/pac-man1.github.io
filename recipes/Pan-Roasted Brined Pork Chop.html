    <li></li>
    <li>1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon juniper berries</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>1 head of garlic, halved crosswise, plus 2 unpeeled cloves for basting</li>
    <li>2 large sprigs thyme</li>
    <li>1 2-inch-thick bone-in pork chop (2 ribs; about 1 1/4 lb.)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grapeseed or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>Flaky or coarse sea salt</li>
    <li></li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add kosher salt, sugar, juniper berries, peppercorns, halved head of garlic, and 1 thyme sprig; stir to dissolve salt and sugar. Transfer to a medium bowl and add 5 cups ice cubes. Stir until brine is cool. Add pork chop; cover and chill for at least 8 and up to 12 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450°. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Remove chop from brine; pat dry. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large cast-iron or other oven-proof skillet. Cook chop until beginning to brown, 3-4 minutes. Turn and cook until second side is beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Keep turning chop every 2 minutes until both sides are deep golden brown, 10-12 minutes total.</li>
    <li>Transfer skillet to oven and roast chop, turning every 2 minutes to prevent it from browning too quickly, until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center of meat registers 135°, about 14 minutes. (Chop will continue to cook during basting and resting.)</li>
    <li>Carefully drain fat from skillet and place over medium heat. Add butter, 2 unpeeled garlic cloves, and remaining thyme sprig; cook until butter is foamy. Carefully tip skillet and, using a large spoon, baste chop repeatedly with butter until butter is brown and smells nutty, 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer pork chop to prepared rack and let rest, turning often to ensure juices are evenly distributed, for 15 minutes. Cut pork from bones, slice, and sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
