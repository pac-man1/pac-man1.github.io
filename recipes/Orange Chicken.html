    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>Vegetable Or Peanut Oil For Frying</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>4 whole Egg Whites</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons Cornstarch</li>
    <li>4 whole Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs, Cut Into Bite Sized Pieces</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>[Sauce]</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Orange Juice</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Packed Brown Sugar (OR White Sugar OR Honey)</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Rice Vinegar (or Regular Distilled Vinegar)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon Sesame Oil</li>
    <li>Dash Of Salt</li>
    <li>Dash Of Crushed Red Pepper, More To Taste</li>
    <li>1 clove Garlic, Pressed Or Minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Minced Ginger</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Cornstarch (additional)</li>
    <li>Zest Of 1 Orange (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Water</li>
    <li>2 whole Green Onions, Sliced</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <div class="recipeInstructions"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>For the chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and egg whites with a fork until almost frothy, about 1 minute. Add the chicken to the mixture and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>For the sauce: Meanwhile, put the orange juice, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, sesame oil, salt, crushed red pepper, garlic and ginger (and orange zest, if using) in a small nonstick skillet and whisk together. Heat until bubbling and starting to thicken, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Whisk together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the cornstarch slurry to the sauce. Mix in and thicken for 1 minute. (If sauce gets overly thick, just add in another 1/4 cup water and whisk in.)</li>
    <li>Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. In batches, carefully drop a few pieces of chicken into the oil (drop them in one by one to keep them from sticking together) and move it around, 2-3 minutes or until light golden. Let the pieces drain on a plate lined with paper towels for 2 to 3 minutes. Then drop them back into the oil for 1 minute to really solidify the coating.</li>
    <li>Toss the chicken in the sauce and serve immediately with orange zest and sliced green onions on the top.</li>
