			<div class="recipeIngredients"> 
				<ul>
					<li> 1.5 pounds broccoli</li>
					<li> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
					<li> salt and pepper </li>
					<li> 3 tbsp butter </li>
					<li> 1 medium yellow onion, sliced </li>
					<li> 1 carrot, peeled and finely diced</li>
					<li> 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced </li>
					<li> 2 cups water</li>
					<li> 3 cups whole milk</li>
					<li> 1 small russet potato, peeled and sliced</li>
					<li> 12 ounces (340g) sharp cheddar cheese, grated</li>
					<li> 8 ounces (240g) American cheese (buy it from the deli, not kraft) </li>					
					<li> 1 teaspoon mustard powder </li>
					<li> dash of hot sauce (it won't be spicy, promise) </li>
					<li> optional: serve with a batch of <a href = "recipes/scones.html">, ham and cheese scones </a>.
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="recipeInstructions">
				<ol>
					<li>Separate broccoli into florets and stems. Cut florets into bite-size pieces and set aside. Roughly chop stems and reserve separately.</li>
					<li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add broccoli florets and cook, without moving, until charred on the bottom, about 1 minute. Stir, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until tender and charred on several surfaces, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet to cool.</li>
					<li>Return Dutch oven to medium heat and add butter, onion, carrot, and broccoli stems. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until tender but not browned, about 5 minutes, lowering heat if necessary. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
					<li>Add shrimp, stir and cook for a couple minutes (shrimp should just turn pink and not curl up yet.) Squeeze in lemon juice from half the lemon. Add wine, 1 tbsp butter, salt and pepper, and hot sauce (if using). Stir and reduce heat to low.</li>
					<li>Add water or chicken stock, milk, and potato and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli and potato are completely tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
					<li>In a large bowl, toss both cheeses together along with mustard powder. Using an immersion blender or working in batches with a countertop blender, blend soup, adding cheese a handful at a time, until completely smooth. Stir in hot sauce and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in reserved broccoli florets and pulse with blender a few more times until a few pieces are broken down, but most bite-size pieces remain.</li>
					<li>Serve immediately, preferably with <a href = "recipes/scones.html", ham and cheese scones </a>. Keeps in fridge for a week.</li>
