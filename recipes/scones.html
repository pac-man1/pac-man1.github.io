					<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. </li>
					<li>Sift flour into a medium bowl, then whisk in baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add butter and toss to break up the pieces, then smash each one between your fingertips. Continue smasshing and rubbing until butter disappears.</li>
					<li>Add diced ham, scallion, and shy 1/4 cup cheese (the rest is used to top the scones). Toss until well combined, then stir in milk and cream to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat into a 7-inch round, at least 1 inch thick. Cut into 6 wedges and arrange on a parchment-lined pan</li>
					<li>Bake in the oven until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes. Halfway through, top with remaining cheese. Let cool at least 5 minutes</li>
					<li>Serve with <a href = "../recipes/broccolicheese.html"> Broccoli & Cheese Soup </a> or leftovers can be stored up to 2 days in an airtight container and warmed in oven to serve.</li>
