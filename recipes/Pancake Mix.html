    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda (check expiration date first)</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 eggs, separated</li>
    <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>2 cups "Instant" Pancake Mix, recipe above</li>
    <li>1 stick butter, for greasing the pan</li>
    <li>2 cups fresh fruit such as blueberries, if desired</li>
    <li></li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Combine all of the ingredients in a lidded container. Shake to mix.</li>
    <li>Use the mix within 3 months.</li>
    <li>Heat an electric griddle or frying pan to 350 degrees F. Heat oven to 200 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Whisk together the egg whites and the buttermilk in a small bowl. In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the melted butter.</li>
    <li>Combine the buttermilk mixture with the egg yolk mixture in a large mixing bowl and whisk together until thoroughly combined. Pour the liquid ingredients on top of the pancake mix. Using a whisk, mix the batter just enough to bring it together. Don't try to work all the lumps out.</li>
    <li>Check to see that the griddle is hot by placing a few drops of water onto to the griddle. The griddle is ready if the water dances across the surface.</li>
    <li>Lightly butter the griddle. Wipe off thoroughly with a paper towel. (No butter should be visible.)</li>
    <li>Gently ladle the pancake batter onto the griddle and sprinkle on fruit if desired. When bubbles begin to set around the edges of the pancake and the griddle-side of the cake is golden, gently flip the pancakes. Continue to cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the pancake is set.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately or remove to a towel-lined baking sheet and cover with a towel. Hold in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Yield: 12 pancakes</li>
    <li></li>
