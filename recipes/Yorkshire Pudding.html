    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>75 g all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>88 g whole milk</li>
    <li>12 g water</li>
    <li>1 g kosher salt (about 1/4 teaspoon)</li>
    <li>50 ml beef drippings, lard, shortening, butter or vegetable oil (about 1/4 cup)</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Combine eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate batter overnight or for up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while you preheat the oven.</li>
    <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly into one 6-well popover tins. Preheat in the oven until the fat is smoking hot, less than 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the tin to a heat-proof surface (such as an aluminum baking sheet on your stovetop), and divide the batter evenly between every well. The wells should be filled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (Dont worry about leftover batter, it’s better than it splattering everywhere). Immediately return to oven. Bake until the yorkshire puddings have just about quadrupled in volume, are deep brown all over, crisp to the touch, and sound hollow when tapped. Popover-sized ones will take around 25 minutes (less if convection).</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with golden syrup or honey</li>
    <li></li>
