    <div class="recipeIngredients"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>1 bunch broccoli rabe, tough lower stems removed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pistachios, toasted</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 pound orecchiette pasta</li>
    <li>High-quality extra-virgin olive oil, for finishing (optional)</li>
    <li></li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of well-salted ice water. Cook the broccoli rabe in the boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes and then immediately plunge in the salted ice water. This will prevent the broccoli rabe from being overcooked and will set the lovely green color.</li>
    <li>Drain the broccoli rabe and squeeze out any excess water; coarsely chop. Place the broccoli rabe in the bowl of a food processor and puree until it is a coarse paste. Add the pistachios and parmigiano and puree until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning; you probably will need more salt. Add the ricotta and pulse until combined. Taste for seasoning once again-it should be full-flavored, slightly bitter and creamy at the same time. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. (If you are making the pasta right after the pesto, just use the broccoli rabe blanching water.) Cook the pasta 1 minute less than the cooking time on the package.</li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, place the pesto in a large skillet and add about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the pasta cooking water; place over medium-high heat. When the pasta is ready, drain and add to the skillet with the pesto. Stir vigorously to combine and cook until the sauce is creamy and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes; add salt to taste. Remove from the heat, add 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, if desired, and stir vigorously. Garnish with more parmigiano. Voila!</li>
