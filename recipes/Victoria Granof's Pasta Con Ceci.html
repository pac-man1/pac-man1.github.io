    <li></li>
    <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons good tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (or one 15-ounce can, drained and rinsed)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup uncooked ditalini pasta (or another small shape, like macaroni)</li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil until it shimmers. Add the garlic and cook, stirring until it becomes lightly browned and fragrant. Stir in the tomato paste and salt and fry for 30 seconds or so. Add the chickpeas, pasta, and boiling water. Stir to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, lower the heat, and simmer until the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. To serve, ladle the pasta into shallow bowls, sprinkle with crushed red pepper flakes, and drizzle a bit of extra-virgin olive oil on top.</li>
