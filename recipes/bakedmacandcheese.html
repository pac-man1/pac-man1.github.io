    <li>3 bay leaves</li>
    <li>Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter (plus 2 optional tablespoons)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Heat the oven to 375Â°F and grease a 9- by 13-inch pan. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Add the macaroni and cook until just beginning to turn tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Put the milk, bay leaves, cayenne, and some salt and pepper in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. As it warms up, put the 4 tablespoons butter in another large saucepan over medium heat. When it melts, add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture turns golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually whisk the warm milk mixture into the butter mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove the bay leaves, and stir in all but about 1 cup of the cheese. Toss the sauce with the macaroni, then transfer the mixture to the greased pan and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</li>
    <li>If you want a breadcrumb topping, put the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet. When it melts, add the breadcrumbs and toss to coat them with the butter. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the macaroni and cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake until the cheese is bubbling and the topping is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot or warm. (Store leftover macaroni and cheese in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a few days.)</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Notes: For Taylors, get a block of jack and a block of cheddar. Use cornflakes for breadcrumbs.</li>
