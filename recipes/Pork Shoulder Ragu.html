    <li></li>
    <li>2 to 2 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder roast, tied with twine if there are any loose pieces</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small pat butter</li>
    <li>1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes, with juice</li>
    <li>1 cup red wine</li>
    <li>5 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
    <li>5 sprigs fresh oregano</li>
    <li>Small handful of fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, for smokiness (Andy used Trader Joe's Hot Chili Sauce, but Sriracha and Tabasco both work great, too)</li>
    <li>Pappardelle</li>
    <li>Freshly grated Parmesan</li>
    <li></li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325° F. Liberally salt and pepper the pork roast. Add olive oil and butter to large Dutch oven and heat over medium-high until butter melts, but does not burn. Add pork roast to pan and brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes in all. Add the onion and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, wine, thyme, oregano, fennel, and hot sauce and bring to a boil. Cover, and put in oven. Braise for 3 to 4 hours, turning every hour or so. Add more liquid (water, wine, or tomato sauce) if needed. (The liquid should come to about 1/3 of the way up the pork.) Meat is done when it’s practically falling apart. Put on a cutting board (remove the sprigs of herbs at the same time) and pull it apart with two forks, then add back to pot and stir. Cook 1 to 2 pounds pasta according to package directions. When it’s is ready, put into individual bowls and top with ragu and lots of Parm. Alternately, toss the pasta with the ragu and a bit of pasta cooking water, as needed, and top with Parm.</li>
