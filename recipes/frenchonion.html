    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>1 red onion</li>
    <li>3 yellow onions</li>
    <li>1 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups white wine</li>
    <li>1 32 oz box beef stock</li>
    <li>1/2 32 oz box chicken stock</li>
    <li>splash or two of apple cider</li>
    <li>3 thyme sprigs</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 baguette</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup Gruyere cheese, grated (sliced is too much)</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>

    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Trim the ends off each onion then halve lengthwise. Remove peel and finely slice using v-slicer. Add butter to dutch oven over medium heat. Once butter has melted add a layer of onions and sprinkle with a little salt. Repeat layering onions and salt until all onions are in.</li>
    <li>Add thyme and bay leaf (keep both whole to pull out at end)</li>
    <li>Do not try stirring until onions have sweated down for 15 to 20 minutes. After that, stir occasionally until onions are dark mahogany and reduced to approximately 2 cups. This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour. Do not worry about burning until close to end.</li>
    <li>Add enough wine to cover the onions and turn heat to high, reducing the wine to a syrup consistency.</li>
    <li>Add beef and chicken broth, and apple cider. Reduce heat and simmer 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place oven rack in top 1/3 of oven and heat broiler.</li>
    <li>Cut bread at an angle in rounds large enough to fit mouth of oven safe soup crocks. Place the slices on a baking sheet and place under broiler for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Season soup mixture with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Remove thyme and bay leaf and ladle soup into crocks leaving one inch to the lip.</li>
    <li>Place bread round, toasted side down, on top of soup and top with grated cheese. Broil until cheese is bubbly and golden, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
