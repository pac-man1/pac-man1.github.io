    <div class="recipeIngredients"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>14 -ounce bag frozen peas (a full pound is fine, too)</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons onion, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Parmesan, freshly grated</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <div class="recipeInstructions"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>In a soup pot or dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and saut√© until it becomes lightly golden. In a separate pot, heat the stock until it reaches a simmer.</li>
    <li>Once the onion is ready, add 3 cups of the simmering stock, the rice, the bag of frozen peas, and a good pinch of salt. Cover the pot and and cook at a low boil for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is just tender. If the soup is too thick, thin it slightly with the remaining stock; it should be thick but not porridge. When the rice is ready, add the grated Parmesan and taste for salt. Serve.</li>
