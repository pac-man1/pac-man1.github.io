			<div class="recipeIngredients"> 
				<ul>
					<li> 1 box bucatini pasta (or spaghetti)</li>
					<li> 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil </li>
					<li> 2 slices good bacon, diced </li>
					<li> 1 shallot, finely chopped (shallot is important, can't sub onion) </li>
					<li> 1 garlic clove, finely chopped </li>
					<li> 1 cup heavy cream </li>
					<li> 2 tbsp grated parmesan / parmigiano-reggiano cheese, plus more for topping (freshly grated cheese is best) </li>
					<li> 4 large egg yolks</li>
					<li> salt and pepper</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="recipeInstructions">
				<ol>
					<li>Prep by separating egg yolks, chopping garlic and shallot and bacon, measuring cream, grating cheese. </li>
					<li>Pull out a large pot and a large skillet. Boil water in large pot, and dump in a handful of salt so it tastes like the ocean. </li>
					<li>Just before cooking the pasta, heat the olive oil in the large skillet over medium heat and start cooking the bacon. </li>
					<li>Add the pasta to the boiling water, cook the pasta until al dente, 1 minute less than the suggestion on the box. </li>
					<li>Cook bacon until almost fully rendered/crispy. Add the shallot and garlic and cook for 1 minute at most (try not to burn the garlic). </li>
					<li>Add the cream to the skillet and simmer until slightly thickened, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes. </li>
					<li>When the pasta is done, save about a cup of cooking water and then drain the pasta. </li>		<li>Cover and transfer to the oven. Bake on the bottom rack during the last 25 minutes of roasting time for the vegetables</li>
					<li>Add the egg yolks-- they will cook in the remaining heat in the pasta and form a beautiful sauce. It has to be off the heat to avoid making scrambled eggs. </li>
					<li>Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with more parmesan cheese.</li>
