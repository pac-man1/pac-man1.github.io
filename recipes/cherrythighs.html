					<li> 1/2 pound broccoli</li>
					<li> 2 scallions</li>
					<li> 1 pound/1 large sweet potato </li>
					<li> 1 tbsp sour cherry spread/ tart cherry jelly</li>
					<li> 2 tbsp soy glaze (can order it online)</li>

				<ol>
					<li>Prep: heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling. Wash and dry fresh produce. Peel and medium dice sweet potatoes. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 ince of broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into small florets. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice, separating the white bottoms and green tops.</li>
					<li>In a medium bowl, combine the cherry spread, vinegar, soy glaze, and 1/4 cup water. This glaze will later be spread on the chicken. </li>
					<li>Add diced sweeet potatoes to the boiling water. Cook 14 to 16 minutes, or until fork tender. Drain and return to pot, add the butter and a drizzle of olive oil. Mash with a fork or potato masher, season with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.</li>
					<li>While potatoes are boiling, cook broccoli in a medium (nonstick) pan with a drizzle of olive oil and the white bottoms of the scallions. Season with salt and pepper and cook 1 to 2 minutes until lightly browned. Add 1/4 cup water. Loosely cover the pan with foil and cook 3-4 minutes, until softened. Transfer to a plate, cover with the foil to keep warm, and wipe out the pan. </li>
					<li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat 2 tsp olive oil in the same pan, add the chicken and cook 6-7 minutes on first side until browned. Flip and cook 5 minutes. Add the glaze and cook, spooning the glaze over chicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.</li>
					<li>Serve the glazed chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and cooked proccoli. Top the chicken with any remaing glaze from the pan, and garnish the the sliced green tops of the scallions.</li>
