    <div class="recipeIngredients"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>1 lb bucatini, linguine, or fettuccine</li>
    <li>1/2 lemon</li>
    <li>1/2 Cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3/4 Cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <div class="recipeInstructions"></div>
    <ul></ul>
    <li>Instructions:</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boiling</li>
    <li>Add salt and drop in the pasta. Cook for 2 minutes less than package directions</li>
    <li>Cut the lemon in half and examine. If the pith is too thick zest and juice the lemon, otherwise cut into wedges and drop into a blender, seeds and skin included. Add the cream, 1/4 cup olive oil, egg, and Parmesan.</li>
    <li>Set the blender to pur√©e, scraping down the sides of the carafe once, then run the machine again until the lemon cream is thick and fully emulsified.</li>
    <li>Check the pasta for doneness (should be al dente). Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water.</li>
    <li>Off the heat, dump the pasta back into the pan, along with 1/4 cup of that reserved cooking liquid. Working quickly, pour most of the sauce onto the noodles and toss to combine. Keep turning the noodles into the sauce, adding more sauce and splashes of reserves cooking water until the sauce looks thickened and glossy and coats the pasta.</li>
